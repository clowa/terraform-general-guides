# Overview

This repo is kind of my bulletin board. A collection of all my notes I made on my journey to learn terraform.

## Structure

- `best_practices/`: Best practices for writing terraform code in general, not specific to modules.
- `introduction/`: General introduction to terraform and infrastructure as code.
- `modules/`: Best practices for writing terraform modules, testing terraform code, and deploying terraform code.
